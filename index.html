<h1 class="ht">Hiking tips</h1>
<p class="ht">If you ask anyone what they did over the weekend (or what’s on tap for the next one) 
one response you’re sure to hear in the Bay Area is, “hiking”.
One of the best parts of living in San Francisco is that there’s so much to explore. 
Like all the hiking trails in and around the city, perfect for getting your fitness on.
Whether you’re looking for a rigorous workout, a scenic stroll with friends, 
or a romantic walkabout, there’s an SF-area hike perfect for you.
Many hiks are so nice we do them over and over again, repeating best adventures previously 
discovered and exploring more hidden opportunities each time we go.</p>
<p class="ht">Do you know that 'hiking' is the preferred term, in Canada and the United States, 
for a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails, in the countryside, while the word
walking is used for shorter, particularly urban walks. In the United Kingdom, and the Republic 
of Ireland, the word "walking" is acceptable to describe all forms of walking, whether it is 
a walk in the park or backpacking. The term bushwalking is endemic to Australia, 
having been adopted by the Sydney Bush Walkers club in 1927. In New Zealand a long, 
vigorous walk or hike is called tramping. It is a popular activity with numerous hiking
organizations worldwide, and studies suggest that all forms of walking have health benefits.

<p class="bh">Safety Tips</p>
<p>Without proper planning and packing, even a short day hike could turn 
into a potentially dangerous outing. So, before you brush off weekday stress and 
lace up your hiking boots, remember these eight hiking safety tips.</p>
<li><b>1. Make a Gear List</b><br>
Make a gear list before heading out to make sure you have everything you might need. 
The must-have list includes: water, extra water, rain gear, compass, map and extra food.</li>
<li><b>2. Bring a Map</b><br>
You should never rely only on GPS technology, especially with limited service and 
unreliable battery power. Always pack a map, and if you're not sure how to read one, 
take some time to learn beforehand.</li>	
<li><b>3. Hike During the Day</b><br>
Plan to hike during the day; the region where you're hiking may be home to a variety 
of wild animals that come slinking out at night. The best way to avoid being stuck out 
in the dark is to set a turnaround time. Regardless of how far you hike, you should 
stick to your predetermined time to ensure you finish hiking before the sun goes down.</li> 	
<li><b>4. Know the Area</b><br>
Exploring new hiking trails is always exciting. Before heading out, check regional
hiking information for: Local wild animals and what to do if you come across one; 
Local poisonous plants—think poison ivy, sumac, oak; Local hunting areas/seasons;
Any and all hiking alerts.</li>
<li><b>5. Check the Forecast before you leaving</b><br>
This is important in determining what gear you need to bring, like a rain jacket, sunscreen, 
extra water or warmer clothing.</li>
<li><b>6. Be Confident Not Cocky</b><br>
Whether you've hiked 30 times or five, you know what you can and can't handle.
Don't risk injury; be honest with your skill level before hitting the trail.</li>
<li><b>7. Tell Someone Before You Go</b></li>
<li><b>8. Stay Together</b><br>
Last but not least, stick together, if you are going in the group.</li><br>

<p class="bh">Hiking with Kids</p>
<p>Hiking with your children is a great way to get them connected to the outdoors. 
Just remember to keep the goals easy.</p>
<li>Start with short hikes that feature a goal — the waterfall you came to 
see, the lake where you can wade and play</li>
<li>Plan to take a lot of extra time. If you don’t reach your goal because 
the kids want to explore under every leaf, then that’s a good hike, too.  
With children, it’s about the journey, not the destination.</li>
<p class="bh">Hiking with Dogs</p>
<li>Make sure your dog is up to date on all vaccinations and ensure those 
identification tags are firm on the collar.</li>
<li>Remember that dogs need to train and condition for longer hikes, too, 
so don’t forget to bring them along on your short day trips.</li>
<li>With a special pack and time to get used to it, your dog can carry 
his or her own provisions.</li>
<li>Do a thorough health check at the end of each day, and include canine-friendly
supplies in your first aid kit.</li>
<li>Always check the trail rules before you go; you don’t want your dog 
harassing wildlife. National Park trails do not allow dogs, while other 
public lands simply require dogs to be on a leash.</li><br>

<p class="bh">Tips to Help Make your San Francisco Hiking better:</p>	
<li><b>Dress in layers! </b>Temperatures can vary dramatically
from one side of a hill to another 
or from morning until afternoon.</li>
<li><b>Yes, there are hills. </b>Don’t try to do too much 
the first time if you are not in good shape. 
That’s no fun.</li>
<li><b>Watch for interesting opportunities. </b> 
San Francisco is full of great nooks and crannies 
where it is worth your while to spend more time. 
Stop and smell the many beautiful roses.</li><br>
